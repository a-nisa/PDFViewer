# PDF Viewer Web Application
PDF Viewer is a simple web application that uses the Adobe PDF View SDK to allow users to read and manipulate PDF files easily while maintaining quality.    

## Structure
The web app consists of a single `index.html` file and corresponding stylesheet `style.css` and scripting file `script.js` in the root directory. 

The core functionality is contained in `script.js` which makes appropriate call to the **View SDK**, configures the `adobeDCView` object and supports *Embed View Mode switching*.

## PDF View SDK Credentials    
Ì¥The credentials used during development have been left intact so as to facilitate the reviewers during review.

## Google Analytics
The analytics tracking code is placed under the `<head>` tag in `index.html`.
> To setup your own google analytics, please swap the tracking code in `index.html` under the `<head>` tag with your own.
